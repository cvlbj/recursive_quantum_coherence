the simulation so far:

Coherence Preservation with Feedback:

The addition of feedback stabilizes the wavepacket and prevents its natural spread, maintaining coherence across layers.
This suggests that a structured feedback mechanism can counteract the effects of chaos or grid-induced perturbations, but it does not yet show deterministic outcomes from chaos (like superwires).
Incorporating Stochastic Collapse:

Introducing stochastic collapse alongside feedback can simulate measurement-like behavior, helping us examine whether collapse tendencies align with coherence feedback.
This would allow exploration of whether the recursive feedback mechanism guides the system toward specific deterministic outcomes.
Addressing Initial Objectives
What We Have Achieved:
Recursive Coherence Loss: We've observed how coherence diminishes across recursive layers due to grid artifacts, with or without feedback.
Feedback Mechanism Efficiency: Feedback prevents coherence loss and stabilizes the wavepacket, potentially mimicking real-world stabilizing mechanisms in quantum systems (e.g., interactions with an environment).
Transition Between Chaos and Determinism: So far, we haven't observed deterministic outcomes emerging from chaos as in "superwires" or Eric Heller's work. The recursive layering shows preservation of coherence but not emergent deterministic paths.
Gaps in Our Initial Reasoning:
Coherence as a Utility: The recursive coherence in this framework is useful for stabilizing dynamics, but it does not yet produce deterministic structures.
Missing Deterministic Patterns: Superwires arise from interference effects in specific chaotic systems; in our model, feedback stabilizes but doesn't induce interference patterns strong enough to mimic deterministic classical trajectories.
Suggestions for Further Exploration:
Add Feedback with Stochastic Collapse:

Include a collapse mechanism that mimics measurement (collapsing into discrete states like 0 or 1), coupled with feedback. This could help explore if deterministic structures emerge from the interplay between feedback and stochastic processes.
Experiment with Nonlinear Feedback:

Modify the feedback potential to depend nonlinearly on the density or introduce phase-dependent feedback. This could amplify interference effects and mimic deterministic trajectories.
Efficiency Through Recursive Feedback:

Use recursive feedback layers to refine computational representations:
Feedback could be used to selectively enhance coherence in specific regions or patterns.
Recursive refinement might reduce the need for high-resolution grids, leveraging feedback to stabilize artifacts more efficiently.
Alternate Grid Configurations:

Introduce adaptive grids or explore coherence evolution in phase space. This might provide insights into how deterministic trajectories emerge in different grid regimes.
Potential Utility:
If we can demonstrate deterministic outcomes or trajectories from recursive coherence and feedback (with or without stochastic collapse), it could provide a new way to model the transition from quantum to classical systems computationally. This could find applications in:

Quantum Simulations: Modeling decoherence or emergent classical behavior in complex quantum systems.
Fractal Physics: Refining recursive structures for more efficient simulations of chaotic systems or fractal-like behaviors.
Stochastic Optimization: Leveraging feedback mechanisms for solving optimization problems influenced by randomness.
