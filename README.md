Recursive Coherence Loss: We've observed how coherence diminishes across recursive layers due to grid artifacts, with or without feedback.
Feedback Mechanism Efficiency: Feedback prevents coherence loss and stabilizes the wavepacket, potentially mimicking real-world stabilizing mechanisms in quantum systems (e.g., interactions with an environment).
Transition Between Chaos and Determinism: So far, we haven't observed deterministic outcomes emerging from chaos as in "superwires" or Eric Heller's work. The recursive layering shows preservation of coherence but not emergent deterministic paths.
Gaps in Our Initial Reasoning:
Coherence as a Utility: The recursive coherence in this framework is useful for stabilizing dynamics, but it does not yet produce deterministic structures.
Missing Deterministic Patterns: Superwires arise from interference effects in specific chaotic systems; in our model, feedback stabilizes but doesn't induce interference patterns strong enough to mimic deterministic classical trajectories.
